# Bikesharing Challenge

Purpose of this project is to utilize Tableau with data pulled [Citi Bike System Data page](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data). Data pulled will be from August 2019 file. 

Conclusions drawn from this is when looking at activity from midnight to 2AM, we see bicyclist are activity dropping significantly by 1AM and is expected this is regular sleep hours. There seems to be more activity from "Male" as compared to "Female" represented in this [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/john.pham4976/viz/Challenge2_16295920861730/Dashboard2?publish=yes).
